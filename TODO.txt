Handshake phase:
  client and server authenticate via certificates
    generate and send certs with every message

  client will assign data encryption and integrity protection

  client and server will send encrypted nonces to each other
  that are xored together to create the master secret

  compute a hash of all messages exchanged and exchange these hashes
    use keyed SHA-1 for the hash

  generate four keys:
    two each for encryption
    two for authentication
    * one for each direction
    * use master secret as the key material

Data Phase:
  Transfer a file using the SSL record format
  
  Decrypt the file at the client and do a diff of the original to verify
